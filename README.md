# Music-Genre-Classification

Using the GTZAN dataset from kaggle we would like to create a program the classifies music into 10 distinct genres. To accomplish this goal, we selected three models we thought would be most suitable - neural networks, k-nearest neighbours and logistic regression - and an appropriate dataset. After doing preprocessing on each of these models, we evaluated the initial accuracy scores on the test and validation sets and noticed some parameters we could use to improve performance. Finally, these steps allowed us to gain high accuracy scores for most of the models; we also outlined our future plans if our project was continued.

To run the model run the main.py file inside the src folder
  * After running the code, there will be a command line interface in the terminal. Enter a number from 1-4 corresponding to the model you would like to run
  * Additional files inside "notebooks" folder directs to jypter notebooks correspoding to each model
