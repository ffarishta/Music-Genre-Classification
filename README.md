# Music-Genre-Classification

Using the GTZAN dataset from kaggle we would like to create a program the classifies music into 10 distinct genres. To accomplish this goal, we selected three models we thought would be most suitable - neural networks, k-nearest neighbours and logistic regression - and an appropriate dataset. After doing preprocessing on each of these models, we evaluated the initial accuracy scores on the test and validation sets and noticed some parameters we could use to improve performance. Finally, these steps allowed us to gain high accuracy scores for most of the models; we also outlined our future plans if our project was continued.
