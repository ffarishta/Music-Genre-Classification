# Music-Genre-Classification

This goal is intended to facilitate music classification, in order to enable the creation of better music-related applications that cater to the needs of consumers. To accomplish this goal, we selected three models we thought would be most suitable - neural networks, k-nearest neighbours and logistic regression - and an appropriate dataset. After doing preprocessing on each of these models, we evaluated the initial accuracy scores on the test and validation sets and noticed some parameters we could use to improve performance. Finally, these steps allowed us to gain high accuracy scores for most of the models; we also outlined our future plans if our project was continued.
